@article{Larsson2012,
abstract = {This paper introduces a matrix-valued analog of the Bessel processes, taking values in the set \$E\$ of real square matrices with nonnegative determinant. Focus is on existence and uniqueness, and especially the latter leads us to develop several new results of potential theoretic nature concerning the space of real square matrices. Specifically, the function \$w(x)=|\backslash det x|\^{}\backslash alpha\$ is a weight function in Muckenhoupt \$A\_p\$ class for \$-1<\backslash alpha\backslash le 0\$ (\$p=1\$) and \$-1<\backslash alpha<p-1\$ (\$p>1\$). The set of matrices of co-rank at least two has zero capacity with respect to the measure \$m(dx)=|\backslash det x|\^{}\backslash alpha dx\$ if \$\backslash alpha>-1\$, and if \$\backslash alpha\backslash ge 1\$ this even holds for the set of all singular matrices. As a consequence we obtain density results for Sobolev spaces over \$E\$ with Neumann boundary conditions. In obtaining these results we rely crucially on the stratification of the state space into smooth manifolds consisting of fixed-rank matrices. We also discuss the relation between the matrix-valued Bessel processes and the well-known Wishart processes.},

abstract = {The theory of affine processes on the space of positive semidefinite d x d matrices has been established in a joint work with Cuchiero, Filipovi$\backslash$'c and Teichmann (2011). We confirm the conjecture stated therein that in dimension d greater than 1 this process class does not exhibit jumps of infinite total variation. This constitutes a geometric phenomenon which is in contrast to the situation on the positive real line (Kawazu and Watanabe, 1974). As an application we prove that the exponentially affine property of the Laplace transform carries over to the Fourier-Laplace transform if the diffusion coefficient is zero or invertible.},
