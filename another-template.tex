% pslatex is a very obsolete package and that its descendant mathptmx is rather inadequate for serious typesetting involving math.
% If you don't need mathematics, other choices based on (Linotype) Times Roman are
%  - tgtermes
%  - newtxtext (based on txfonts, but with corrected metrics) (with its companion math package newtxmath)
%
%
% See:
% http://www.latex-community.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=6637
%
% (times, helvet, courier)
% pslatex and txfonts produce (almost) same resutls.
% pslatex supposedly obsolete
% txfonts supposedly up-to-date
%
%
% See:
% ftp://ftp.rrzn.uni-hannover.de/pub/mirror/tex-archive/info/l2tabu/english/l2tabuen.pdf
% or 
% ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/info/l2tabu/english/l2tabuen.pdf
% in
% 2.3.3 pslatex.sty
%
% pslatex uses a Courier font scaled too narrowly.
% Its main disadvantage is that it does not work with T1 and TS1 encodings.
% So replace:
% \usepackage{pslatex} or \usepackage{txfonts}
% by all three:
% - \usepackage{mathptmx}
% - \usepackage[scaled=.90]{helvet}
% - \usepackage{courier}
%
%
% See:
% http://xpt.sourceforge.net/techdocs/language/latex/latex32-LaTeXAndFonts/single/
% or http://thirteen-01.stat.iastate.edu/wiki/LaTeXFonts
% or http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/info/beginlatex/html/chapter8.html
%
% When changing fonts, you can change all of the default fonts at once with the following commands:
% 
% Command     Changes the defaults to
% 
% times       Times, Helvetica, Courier
% pslatex     same as Times, but uses a specially narrowed Courier. This is preferred over Times because of the way it handles Courier.
% newcent     New Century Schoolbook, Avant Garde, Courier
% palatino    Palatino, Helevetica, Courier
% palatcm     changes the Roman to Palatino only, but uses CM mathematics
% kpfonts     "Kepler" fonts. A very nicely evolved set of fonts also based originally on Palatino, but with many special features.
%
%
% See:
% http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/59702/suggest-a-nice-font-family-for-my-basic-latex-template-text-and-math-i-am
%
% There are, of course, many other font packages, most of which provide "only" text-mode fonts.
% Among these are the "TeX-Gyre" font families: 
%  - Termes (a Times Roman clone), 
%  - Pagella (a Palatino clone), and 
%  - Schola (a Century Schoolbook clone); 
% one would load the packages tgtermes, tgpagella, and tgschola, respectively, to access these fonts.
% However, as these are text fonts, you still need to choose a suitable math font.
% 
% Still another possibility you may want to look into is the Linux Libertine font family, to be loaded via the libertine-legacy package.
% If you like this text font and wish to employ the newtxmath package, be sure to load the newtxmath package with the libertine option set;
% doing so will set up a special set of math-mode fonts that harmonizes well with the libertine text fonts.
