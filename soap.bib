@article{Singleton2001a,
abstract = {The known functional form of the conditional characteristic function (CCF) of discretely sampled observations from an affine diffusion is used to develop computationally tractable and asymptotically efficient estimators of the parameters of affine diffusions, and of assetpricing models in which the state vectors follow affine diffusions. Both ‘time-domain’ estimators, based on Fourier inversion of the CCF, and ‘frequency-domain’ estimators, based directly on the CCF, are constructed. A method-of-moments estimator based on the CCF is shown to approximate the efficiency of maximum likelihood for affine diffusion and asset pricing models.},

@article{Pearson1994,
abstract = {We propose an empirical method that utilizes the conditional density of the state variables to estimate and test a term structure model with known price formulae, using data on both discount and coupon bonds. The method is applied to an extension of a two-factor model due to Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1985; CIR). Our results show that estimates based on only bills imply unreasonably large price errors for longer maturities. We reject the original CIR model using a likelihood ratio test, and conclude that the extended CIR model also fails to provide a good description of the Treasury market.

@article{MAFI:MAFI408,
abstract = {Dai and Singleton (2000) study a class of term structure models for interest rates that specify the short rate as an affine combination of the components of an N-dimensional affine diffusion process. Observable quantities in such models are invariant under regular affine transformations of the underlying diffusion process. In their canonical form, the models in Dai and Singleton (2000) are based on diffusion processes with diagonal diffusion matrices. This motivates the following question: Can the diffusion matrix of an affine diffusion process always be diagonalized by means of a regular affine transformation? We show that if the state space of the diffusion is of the form for integers satisfying or , there exists a regular affine transformation of D onto itself that diagonalizes the diffusion matrix. So in this case, the Dai–Singleton canonical representation is exhaustive. On the other hand, we provide examples of affine diffusion processes with state space whose diffusion matrices cannot be diagonalized through regular affine transformation. This shows that for ), the assumption of diagonal diffusion matrices may impose unnecessary restrictions and result in an avoidable loss of generality.},

@article{collin-dufresne2008,
abstract = {Building on Duffie and Kan (1996), we propose a new representation of affine models in which the state vector comprises infinitesimal maturity yields and their quadratic covariations. Because these variables possess unambiguous economic interpretations, they generate a representation that is globally identifiable. Further, this representation has more identifiable parameters than the “maximal” model of Dai and Singleton (2000). We implement this new representation for select three-factor models and find that model-independent estimates for the state vector can be estimated directly from yield curve data, which present advantages for the estimation and interpretation of multifactor models.},

This condition on the domain and the additional sufficient constraints are restrictive and can considerably diminish the practical interest of affine models. In this article we successfully address the research agenda sketched by Duffie, Filipovic, Schachermayer (2003, section 12.2, p. 1042). A systematic investigation is performed and our article provides a complete typology in the two-factor case, without prior restrictions on the domain and on the parameters.},

We derive closed-form approximations to likelihoods for nine Dai and Singleton (2000) affine models. Simulations show our technique very accurately approximates true (but infeasible) MLE. Using US Treasury data, we estimate nine affine yield models with different market price of risk specifications. MLE allows non-nested model comparison using likelihood ratio tests; the preferred model depends on the market price of risk. Estimation with simulated and real data suggests our technique is much closer to true MLE than Euler and quasi-maximum likelihood (QML) methods.},

The econometric method uses Hansen.'s generalized method of moments and exploits the probability distribution of the single-state variable in CIR.'s model, thus avoiding the use of aggregate consumption data. It enables us to estimate a continuous-time model based on discretely sampled data. The tests indicate that CIR's model for index bonds perform reasonably well when confronted with short-term Treasury-bill returns. The estimates indicate that term premiums are positive and that yield curves can take several shapes. However, the fitted model does poorly in explaining the serial correlation in real Treasury-bill returns.},
